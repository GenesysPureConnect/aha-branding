                <p>Welcome to the Genesys Product Ideas Community! We encourage you to participate by voting on, commenting
                    on, and creating new ideas. All new ideas will be evaluated jointly by the Genesys Product Management
                    & Engineering teams, and the next steps will be clearly communicated. It is important to note that while
                    not all submitted ideas will be executed upon, community feedback will play a key role in influencing
                    which ideas are.</p>
                <p>
                    Before you submit an idea, please perform a search to determine if a similar idea has already been submitted.
